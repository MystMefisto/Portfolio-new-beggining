# About this portfolio

## How does it borned?

Thanks to the community of [soyDalto's community](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtoo4_P6ilCj7jwa4FmA5lQ) because they made me easier to meet with cool people that rather grow with projects. **Dalto is a cool cat.** We are in Whatsapp making every week a project nowadays (in quarentine times,2020).

## About my experience and portfolio

It's hard to start again. 4 months ago I did'n do anything about coding. A real hard relationship that finally broke made me feel bad and just don't do nothing productive. Suffering and etcetera made me replan everything about my life. This portfolio means a new life, a new hope and new plans. With new perpective and everything broken, the world is mine.
